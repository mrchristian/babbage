\begin{quote}



Included here is one chapter where Babbage compiled evidence that publishers were restricting the supply of literature by overchanging the public. Hence the title of the chapter 'Masters Against the Public'.


As we can see, the same type of cartel is in operation two hundered years later in guise of hend fund owned scientific publishers continuing to act againt the interest of the public in pursuit of their own selfish gains.


For his efforts Charles Babbage was blacklisted for ten years and no one would publish his work.


Note from the Editor, Simon Worthington, March 2022, Berlin.
